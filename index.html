        <h2 >Personal profile: </h2>

        <p>
            If I can use one word to describe myself is a hardworker. From a young age I was driven to work hardworker
            , to never give up. That was my motto, 'I won,t give up!', whatever life throws at me, I will handle it 
            with pride. My dream was to study and learn new things. I love learning buut what I find even better is to
            share that knowledge with others. My family motivates me to become the best person I am today.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started working at 17 years old at Painting shop where I worked with little kids and then for a year
            i worked at Roller skating rink as a marshall that teaches kids/ adults to roller skating. Then baby sitting
            and now presently working as general worker at Ice cream pallar. All these jobs learned me is patience.
            I was also a tutor in my final year of high school. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have dream of opening my own tutoring business. Business where I can share my knowledge and help over 
            people to create their potencial. I have few careers I want to do, Firstly a software engineer, then 
            a lawyer and tutoring as side hustle. I want to be Jack of all trades and master of many.

        <h3>Software Enginering Bootcamp - Hypriondev</h3>
        <p>
            I started this bootcamp in April and will finish in October. In this sort time I learned 
            the python langauge, SQLite (Databases), HTML and CSS. I have practical practice with 
            capstone projects. In this projects learned efficient ways to create programs and create 
            creative websites. This bootcamp taught me the practical and theoritical aspects of software
            Engineering. Thus I will be a perfect canidate in any software engineering job oppurtunity.
            I have the experience and qaulification to do it. I am also under the 20 top of my class.
